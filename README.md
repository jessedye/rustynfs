This code is responsible for creating an NFS-like server, which listens for connections from NFS clients and handles read and write requests on files in memory. However, it doesn't fully emulate a complete NFS server with all its features and capabilities.

In a real NFS server, you would typically interact with the operating system's NFS server implementation, which manages file system access and network communication. This involves setting up the NFS server software, configuring exports, managing user permissions, and potentially integrating with other services like LDAP or Kerberos for authentication.

The code you provided creates a basic TCP server that responds to custom NFS-like requests. It doesn't interact directly with the operating system's NFS server functionality. Therefore, to mount and access the shared directory from another Linux box using the mount command, you would need to have a real NFS server running and properly configured on your server machine.

If you want to create a more fully-featured NFS server in Rust, you would need to implement additional functionality to handle NFS protocol specifics, file system operations, permissions management, and possibly integrate with the operating system's NFS subsystem or implement your own NFS server from scratch. This would be a significant undertaking and likely require leveraging existing libraries or frameworks for handling network protocols and file system operations.
